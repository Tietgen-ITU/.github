Hi 🙋‍♂️ My name is Andreas Nicolaj Tietgen. 

I am on my 4th semester on my bachelors Softwaredevelopment at the IT University of Copenhagen. 
What you will see here are some of the assignments and other projects that I have been a part of while taking my Bachelors.

Feel free to have a look and reach out if you have any questions.
