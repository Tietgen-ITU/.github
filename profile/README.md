Hi 🙋‍♂️ My name is Andreas Nicolaj Tietgen. 

I am on my 1st semester on my MSc. in Computer Sciecne at the IT University of Copenhagen after finishing a BSc. in Softwaredevelopment.
What you will see here are some of the assignments and other projects that I have been a part of while taking my Bachelors and Masters degree.

Feel free to have a look and reach out if you have any questions.
